Bootcamp Project â€“ ShoppingCart ðŸ›’

Objective
Extend the ShoppingCart from Phase 1 by adding business rules, discounts, checkout, and persistence while keeping the code testable with TDD, AAA, and FIRST.

Requirements

Cart Management

Discounts
- 10% off if subtotal > 200

- Process payment through a payment service (fake/test double)
- Return the final charged amount

Persistence

- Reload a previously saved cart
- Use in-memory storage (Fake Repository)

Deliverables
- Updated ShoppingCart with discounts, checkout, persistence
- DiscountCalculator for applying rules
- FakePaymentGateway for checkout

- Tests that follow AAA, FIRST, and TDD (Red â†’ Green â†’ Refactor)

Evaluation
- Discounts applied correctly according to rules
- Cart can be saved and reloaded
- Tests are fast, independent, and reliable
- Code design follows SOLID and DIP
